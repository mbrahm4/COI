# COI

Neighborhoods matter for children's health and development. All children should live in neighbordhoods with access to good schools, healthy foods, safe parks and playgrounds, clean air, safe housing and living-wage jobs for the adults in their lives. However, far too many children live in neighborhoods that lack these conditions.

What is the Child Opportunity Index?
The Child Opportunity Index (COI) measures neighborhood opportunity along three domains that matter for children: 1) Education, 2) Health and Environment, and 3) Social and Economic.

The COI ranks neighborhood opportunity based on 29 common conditions within these domains. Each neighborhood receives a Child Opportunity Score and is assigned to an opportunity level: very low, low, moderate, high, or very high opportunity.
